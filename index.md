# Ferrite.jl User & Developer Conference 2023

[Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl) is an open-source
finite element package written in the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org/). On the 6th of October 2023 we will host another
Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at Ruhr University Bochum.

The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, scientific
collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss
how the package can be further developed in the future.

The [program](#program) of the conference will consist of presentations of current research
using Ferrite.jl, followed by a hackathon where participants can discuss and
solve current challenges with the library.

The program will be similar to the one from last year, please have a look at
[Ferrite.jl User & Developer Conference 2022](2022/).

## Target audience

If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we
encourage you to participate.

If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to
the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that
would fit well:

 - Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl (take this opportunity to
   discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on
   regular scientific conferences!)
 - Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia
   package ecosystem
 - Present how you use Ferrite.jl for teaching or for student projects
 - Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you
   are currently using something else.
 - Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would
   like to incorporate it (perhaps describe prior art from other software
   packages)

If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so,
as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl!


## Time and location

The conference will be held at at [Ruhr University Bochum]
(https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) at the [Chair of Continuum Mechanics]
(http://www.lkm.rub.de/)
(Universitätsstraße 150, 44801 Bochum, Germany)
on October 6th, starting at 9:30.

## Program

A preliminary program is given below, more details will follow after registration.

| 09:30-10:00 | **Welcome coffee**
| 10:00-11:00 | **Keynote (online)\\ Julia for scientific high-performance computing: opportunities and challenges**\\ *[Michael Schlottke-Lakemper](https://lakemper.eu/)*\\ The Julia programming language aims to provide a modern approach to scientific computing and was designed with high-performance computing (HPC) in mind. As a consequence, a growing number of research groups are considering Julia as their language of choice for creating the next generation of computational fluid dynamics or structure mechanics codes. In this talk, we will thus discuss benefits of using Julia for such classical HPC workloads, and examine where challenges remain. For some practical insights, we will take a closer look at [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl), a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation laws that has been shown to scale efficiently to more than 50,000 MPI ranks, and share some of the lessons learned during its development.
| 11:00-11:45 | **Presentations**
| 11:45-13:15 | **Lunch break**
| 13:15-14:30 | **Presentations**
| 14:30-15:00 | [**Fika (coffee and snacks)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(Sweden))
| 15:00-17:00 | [**Hackathon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
| 17:00       | **Leaving for dinner**

Coffee and snacks for the morning and afternoon will be provided (for free).

The after work will be at some restaurant where we can order drinks and food.
More information to come.

## Presentations

In the spirit of last year we allocate 20+5 minutes per presentation.
