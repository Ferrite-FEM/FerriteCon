# FerriteCon 2025
FerriteCon 2025 will take place at [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english/) 
outside Copenhagen, Denmark, on August 28th, 2025, supported by
[The Danish Center for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, DCAMM](http://www.dcamm.dk).

## Ferrite.jl User & Developer Conference 2025
[Ferrite.jl](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) is an open-source
finite element package written in the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org/). On Thursday the 28th of August 2025 we will host the fourth annual
Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Lungby, Denmark.

The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, technical and scientific
collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss
how the package can be further developed in the future. The conference will consist of both beginner-friendly 
and advanced presentations on Ferrite.jl and of current research using Ferrite.jl.

You can also have a look at the program of previous editions of FerriteCon:
- [FerriteCon 2022 (Braunschweig, Germany)](/2022/)
- [FerriteCon 2023 (Bochum, Germany)](/2023/)
- [FerriteCon 2024 (Gothenburg, Sweden)](/2024/)

**Target audience for FerriteCon**

If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we
encourage you to participate. While the conference is free of charge, 
[registration](#registration_and_abstract_submission) is necessary.

If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to
the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that
would fit well:

 - Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl (take this opportunity to
   discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on
   regular scientific conferences!)
 - Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia
   package ecosystem
 - Present how you use Ferrite.jl for teaching or for student projects
 - Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you
   are currently using something else.
 - Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would
   like to incorporate it (perhaps describe prior art from other software
   packages)

If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so,
as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl!
