On Thursday the 28th of August 2025 we will host the fourth annual Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at the Technical University of Denmark &#40;DTU&#41; in Lyngby, Denmark.</p> <p>The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, technical and scientific collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss how the package can be further developed in the future. The conference will consist of both beginner-friendly and advanced presentations on Ferrite.jl and of current research using Ferrite.jl.</p> <p>You can also have a look at the program of previous editions of FerriteCon:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/FerriteCon/2022/">FerriteCon 2022 &#40;Braunschweig, Germany&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/FerriteCon/2023/">FerriteCon 2023 &#40;Bochum, Germany&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/FerriteCon/2024/">FerriteCon 2024 &#40;Gothenburg, Sweden&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p><strong>Target audience for FerriteCon</strong></p> <p>If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we encourage you to participate. While the conference is free of charge, <a href="#registration_and_abstract_submission">registration</a> is necessary.</p> <p>If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that would fit well:</p> <ul> <li><p>Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl &#40;take this opportunity to discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on regular scientific conferences&#33;&#41;</p> <li><p>Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia package ecosystem</p> <li><p>Present how you use Ferrite.jl for teaching or for student projects</p> <li><p>Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you are currently using something else.</p> <li><p>Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would like to incorporate it &#40;perhaps describe prior art from other software packages&#41;</p> </ul> <p>If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so, as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl&#33;</p> <h2 id=registration_and_abstract_submission ><a href="#registration_and_abstract_submission" class=header-anchor >Registration and abstract submission</a></h2> <p>To register without a presentation, please register as soon as possible, but latest <strong>15th of August &#40;2025-08-15&#41;</strong>, by sending an email with name and affiliation to <a href="mailto:kloau@dtu.dk">Kim Louisa Auth</a>.</p> <p>To register as a speaker, please submit a title and a brief abstract &#40;~100 words, 3-4 sentences&#41; to <a href="mailto:kloau@dtu.dk">Kim Louisa Auth</a> by the <strong>15th of July &#40;2025-07-15&#41;</strong>.</p> <h2 id=contact ><a href="#contact" class=header-anchor >Contact</a></h2> <p>If you have any questions, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask by sending an email to the organizers:</p> <ul> <li><p>Kim Louisa Auth <a href="mailto:kloau@dtu.dk">kloau@dtu.dk</a></p> <li><p>Knut Andreas Meyer <a href="mailto:knut.andreas.meyer@chalmers.se">knut.andreas.meyer@chalmers.com</a></p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > Last modified: June 17, 2025.
