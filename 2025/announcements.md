### Ferrite-FEM
Based on the results from the doodle, we have decided that [FerriteCon 2025](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/FerriteCon) will take place
on August 28th. If you haven't participated before, this is a great opportunity to meet and interact with other Ferrite users and developers. 
While the conference is free of charge, registration (by August 15th) is required. For giving a presentation, the abstract submission deadline 
is July 31st. Please note that giving talks is **not** reserved for developers, talks about various uses of Ferrite are highly appreciated. 
Please see the [webpage](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/FerriteCon) for further information, it will be continuously updated as the program 
and further details are decided.

### Other channels
[Ferrite.jl](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) is an open-source finite element package written in Julia.
Each year, we organize a user and developer conference. 
This year, it will take place at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Lungby, Denmark, on August 28th.
This is a great opportunity to meet and interact with other Ferrite users and developers, as well as to learn more about Ferrite and computational mechanics
