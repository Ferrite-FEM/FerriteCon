On Monday the 16th of September 2024 we will host the third annual Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p> <p>The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, technical and scientific collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss how the package can be further developed in the future.</p> <p><a href="https://chrisrackauckas.com/">Chris Rackauckas</a> will give a keynote lecture about <em>Extending the Julia SciML Ecosystem to a Backbone for PDEs</em>. </p> <p>The <a href="#program">program</a> of the conference will consist of both beginner-friendly and advanced presentations on Ferrite.jl and of current research using Ferrite.jl.</p> <p>You can also have a look at the program of previous editions of FerriteCon:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="/FerriteCon/2022/">FerriteCon 2022 &#40;Braunschweig, Germany&#41;</a></p> <li><p><a href="/FerriteCon/2023/">FerriteCon 2023 &#40;Bochum, Germany&#41;</a></p> </ul> <p><strong>Target audience for FerriteCon</strong></p> <p>If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we encourage you to participate.</p> <p>If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that would fit well:</p> <ul> <li><p>Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl &#40;take this opportunity to discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on regular scientific conferences&#33;&#41;</p> <li><p>Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia package ecosystem</p> <li><p>Present how you use Ferrite.jl for teaching or for student projects</p> <li><p>Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you are currently using something else.</p> <li><p>Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would like to incorporate it &#40;perhaps describe prior art from other software packages&#41;</p> </ul> <p>If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so, as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl&#33;</p> <p><strong>Presentations for FerriteCon</strong></p> <p>In the spirit of last year we allocate 20&#43;5 minutes per presentation. All presenters have to use their own laptop. The presentations will be streamed via a Zoom meeting. Online presentations are possible, but in-person talks will be prioritized if necessary.</p> <h2 id=julia_meetup_gothenburg ><a href="#julia_meetup_gothenburg" class=header-anchor >Julia Meetup Gothenburg</a></h2> <p>We are happy to announce the first Julia user meetup in Gothenburg, Sweden. The meetup will be held in conjunction with FerriteCon, and will take place at <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en">Chalmers University of Technology</a>. During the meetup <a href="https://chrisrackauckas.com/">Dr. Chris Rackauckas</a> will give a keynote lecture about <em>Extending the Julia SciML Ecosystem to a Backbone for PDEs</em>. The keynote will start at 15.00.</p> <p><strong>About Dr. Chris Rackauckas</strong>: <em>Dr. Chris Rackauckas is the VP of Modeling and Simulation at JuliaHub, the Director of Scientific Research at Pumas-AI, Co-PI of the Julia Lab at MIT, and the lead developer of the SciML Open Source Software Organization. For his work in mechanistic machine learning, his work is credited for the 15,000x acceleration of NASA Launch Services simulations and recently demonstrated a 60x-570x acceleration over Modelica tools in HVAC simulation, earning Chris the US Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Scientific Excellence Award. See more at https://chrisrackauckas.com/. He is the lead developer of the Pumas project and has received a top presentation award at every ACoP in the last 3 years for improving methods for uncertainty quantification, automated GPU acceleration of nonlinear mixed effects modeling &#40;NLME&#41;, and machine learning assisted construction of NLME models with DeepNLME. For these achievements, Chris received the Emerging Scientist award from ISoP.</em></p> <p>To register for the julia meet-up, please send an email to Elias Börjesson &#40;elias.borjesson@chalmers.se&#41;</p> <h2 id=time_and_location ><a href="#time_and_location" class=header-anchor >Time and location</a></h2> <p>The conference and meetup will be held at <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en">Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg</a> at the <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/research/material-computational-mechanics/">Division of Material and Computational Mechanics</a> on September 16th.
