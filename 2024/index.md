# FerriteCon 2024 & Julia Meetup Gothenburg

This year FerriteCon 2024 will be co-located with the first [Julia meetup](#julia_meetup_gothenburg) in Gothenburg, Sweden! Find the [program](#program) and information about [time and location](#time_and_location) below.

## Ferrite.jl User & Developer Conference 2024
[Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl) is an open-source
finite element package written in the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org/). On Monday the 16th of September 2024 we will host the third annual
Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, technical and scientific
collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss
how the package can be further developed in the future.

[Chris Rackauckas](https://chrisrackauckas.com/) will give a keynote lecture about _Extending the Julia SciML Ecosystem to a Backbone for PDEs_. 

The [program](#program) of the conference will consist of both beginner-friendly and advanced presentations on Ferrite.jl and of current research
using Ferrite.jl.

You can also have a look at the program of previous editions of FerriteCon:
- [FerriteCon 2022 (Braunschweig, Germany)](/2022/)
- [FerriteCon 2023 (Bochum, Germany)](/2023/)

**Target audience for FerriteCon**

If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we
encourage you to participate.

If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to
the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that
would fit well:

 - Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl (take this opportunity to
   discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on
   regular scientific conferences!)
 - Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia
   package ecosystem
 - Present how you use Ferrite.jl for teaching or for student projects
 - Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you
   are currently using something else.
 - Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would
   like to incorporate it (perhaps describe prior art from other software
   packages)

If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so,
as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl!

**Presentations for FerriteCon**

In the spirit of last year we allocate 20+5 minutes per presentation.
All presenters have to use their own laptop. The presentations will be streamed via a Zoom meeting.
Online presentations are possible, but in-person talks will be prioritized if necessary.
<!---
 and share their slides via Zoom.
So, please keep your Laptop's Zoom installation up to date.
All presentations will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube.
If you don't feel comfortable with this, please send a short notice, such that we can delete the recording.

## Julia Meetup Gothenburg

We are happy to announce the first Julia user meetup in Gothenburg, Sweden. The meetup will be held in conjunction with FerriteCon, and will take place at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en). During the meetup [Dr. Chris Rackauckas](https://chrisrackauckas.com/) will give a keynote lecture about _Extending the Julia SciML Ecosystem to a Backbone for PDEs_. The keynote will start at 15.00.

__About Dr. Chris Rackauckas__: _Dr. Chris Rackauckas is the VP of Modeling and Simulation at JuliaHub, the Director of Scientific Research at Pumas-AI, Co-PI of the Julia Lab at MIT, and the lead developer of the SciML Open Source Software Organization. For his work in mechanistic machine learning, his work is credited for the 15,000x acceleration of NASA Launch Services simulations and recently demonstrated a 60x-570x acceleration over Modelica tools in HVAC simulation, earning Chris the US Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator Scientific Excellence Award. See more at https://chrisrackauckas.com/. He is the lead developer of the Pumas project and has received a top presentation award at every ACoP in the last 3 years for improving methods for uncertainty quantification, automated GPU acceleration of nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NLME), and machine learning assisted construction of NLME models with DeepNLME. For these achievements, Chris received the Emerging Scientist award from ISoP._

To register for the julia meet-up, please send an email to Elias Börjesson (elias.borjesson@chalmers.se)
